According to a WHO report, 5.3% of all deaths that occurred worldwide in the year 2016 were because of harmful alcohol use [1]. It is the main culprit behind the advancing nature of many chronic diseases. It drastically increases the severity of diseases and also makes the treatments less effective. Alcohol not only affects the person physiologically, but it has many adverse effects psychologically and socially too. Also, the habit of alcoholism leads to huge expenses [2] –[3]. However, alcohol does not just affect society, it also affects the health of children, women and couples as the average population is responsible to around 3.5 billion people [4]. In many ways, alcohol consumption, coupled with its negative effects negatively affects the quality of life for an individual. As well as health, alcohol consumption adversely affects human life. Alcoholics are often forced to consume a number of drugs, including alcoholic tea, alcoholics are often encouraged to smoke, it is difficult to reduce their consumption while in health care centres to get the best results while being aware of the need for abstinence prevention. As well as for their physical illnesses and social health they are also exposed to problems because alcohol itself does not contribute towards health[5].\\n\\n.

According to a WHO report, 5.3% of all deaths that occurred worldwide in the year 2016 were because of harmful alcohol use [1]. It is the main culprit behind the advancing nature of many chronic diseases. It drastically increases the severity of diseases and also makes the treatments less effective. Alcohol not only affects the person physiologically, but it has many adverse effects psychologically and socially too. Also, the habit of alcoholism leads to huge expenses [2] in order to avoid the problems associated with that addiction. Alcohol consumption and alcoholism are related by many human health, but the latter as a whole also affect the development of the human personality in the short term. Although alcoholism can be dangerous and addictive, because of its strong psychological and physical effects, the effects on its symptoms is very limited. In many cases, it is difficult for the health care providers to detect the effects since the body constantly stores the negative data. Alcohol's toxicity and the effects on human health have a profound impact on health and wellbeing. In case you're not aware, alcoholism is widely recognised by the world as the leading cause of death (and the most destructive of all infectious diseases) in the world[3]. It is estimated that up to two billion people suffer from alcoholism[4]. The number of deaths from alcoholism is very high for a disease which affects about one-third of humans worldwide,[3] and the majority is due to the human body's metabolism. Alcoholic consumption is an important part of a growing world that is rapidly changing. The world can't cope with the impact of alcohol. This article discusses the impact of alcohol and alcoholism on human health: The impact of alcohol on human health, and potential consequences. Introduction Alcohol and alcohol dependent people In many circumstances, it is only alcohol that causes alcohol dependence, and there are certain benefits of it to the human body. In some circumstances the relationship with a specific alcohol problem that has affected a person is not clear. Because of the very high level of alcohol consumption and consumption in most countries, it is possible to avoid the problem at all costs, and to improve the health of the patient, with the knowledge that alcohol may help. Nevertheless, the use of alcohol can cause serious side effects and in some cases serious complications of the condition. One of the main methods of controlling alcohol in some forms of treatment is to give it to children as an antidote when drinking a lot and to give it to children where they can stop drinking in the morning or evening. Also the use of alcohol by young people has a dramatic effect on all\n"

              "'. The advent of e-cigarettes as a device to self-administer addictive agents such as cocaine and synthetic cathinones may bring about additional adverse health effects associated with their concurrent use. This review aims to briefly describe e-cigarettes and their different generations, and their co-use with other addictive drugs as well as the use of the device as a tool to self-administer addictive drugs, such as cocaine, etc. content: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are devices that allow the user to inhale nicotine in a vapor, and are primarily marketed as a means of quitting smoking and a less harmful replacement for traditional cigarette smoking. However, further research is needed to determine if vaping nicotine via e-cigarettes can be effective. Conversely, nicotine has been considered a gateway drug to alcohol and other addictive drugs and e-cigarettes containing nicotine may have the same effects. Previous reports have shown that e-cigarette use may open the gate for the use of other drugs including conventional cigarettes, cannabis, opioids, etc. The increasing prevalence of e-cigarettes, particularly among youth and adolescents in the last decade have led to an increase in the dual use of e-cigarettes with alcohol, cannabis, and other illicit drug use like heroin and 3-4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) .

Other forms of tobacco use (e.g., smokeless tobacco) are responsible for addi tional cases of neck and head cancer (USDHHS, 1986; NIH Consensus Conference, 1986). In fact, more than twice as many deaths are caused by tobacco products in this country than by all other addictive drugs combined, including alcohol (USDHHS, 1988).
