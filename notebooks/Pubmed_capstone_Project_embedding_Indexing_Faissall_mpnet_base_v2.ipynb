(2006) also linked \\u2018extraversion and sensation seeking\\u2019 and \\u2018neuroticism and anxiety\\u2019 to drinking motives [64]. The former correlated with enhancement factors and was most common in boys whilst the latter correlated with coping factors and was most common in girls. These associations varied across countries but not across different ethnic groups within the same culture. This review concluded that these two personality types may be gender-specific and that as drinking motives did not emerge until adolescence this may account for the increased severity of drinking problems in college populations. Although the latter is also likely to be influenced by such issues as growing independence in college students and the increased availability of alcohol in this context. Nevertheless, from a preventative perspective, it may be useful to focus on extraverted sensation seeking males who drink for enhancement motives and neurotic anxious females who drink for coping motives. Dimensions of personality, such as a tendency toward sensation seeking, may relate not only to drinking but to the choice of drinking partners and drinking venues. Therefore it is necessary for future research to try and integrate all these variables and examine the influence of each of them on behaviour. Several researchers have begun examining multivariate models of individual differences among college students by taking into account demographic factors, drinking motives, expectancies and personality factors simultaneously Kuntche et al.(2005) refer to the \\u2018motivational model of alcohol use\\u2019 that a motive or reason is a \\u2018necessary condition for drinking\\u2019 [65]. They describe \\u2018four categories of drinking motives\\u2019. These include \\u2018\\u2026to enhance positive mood or well-being\\u2026 to obtain social rewards\\u2026 to attenuate negative emotions and to avoid social rejection\\u2019. Motives may be conscious or unconscious [65]. A related concept of alcohol expectancies refers to beliefs about the cognitive, affective and behavioural effects of alcohol which can be both positive (\\u201cdrinking allows me to relax\\u201d) and negative (\\u201cwhen I drink, I often say things that I regret later\\u201d) [62]. Brennan et al. (1986) examined motives for drinking in college students and identified two general types of drinking motives: drinking for social purposes and drinking for emotional escape or coping purposes [61]. In fact five of the eight papers reviewed by Brennan et al. (1986) discussed alcohol consumption for coping purposes [61]. Conversely, Kuntsche et al. (2005) reported that the majority of drinkers volunteer social motives (e.g. to make a party more enjoyable) which were associated with moderate drinking[65]; drinking for coping purposes was associated with heavy drinking or binge drinking [65]. Burke and Stephens (1999) cite a study by Smith et al. (1995) in which 461 male and female seventh graders (around 12 years of age) completed questionnaires looking at their alcohol use and alcohol expectancies and were reassessed at 12 and 24 months. The results showed that when controlling for pre-existing alcohol use, positive alcohol expectancies was a significant predictor of both early alcohol initiation and subsequent higher levels of alcohol use. Low expectancy teenagers either did not begin to drink at all or increased their drinking only gradually [67]. A similar conclusion was also reached by Baer (2002) [68] and more recently in 2007 by Borsari et al. [62]. In summary, there appear to be some social advantages of alcohol consumption for college students, particularly during their first year at college when social identity is paramount. Indeed, enhancement motives such as drinking to have a good time or to enjoy a party more do not seem to have a strong association with alcohol problems. Drinking to cope with negative emotional states or to reduce tension is consistently associated with alcohol-related problems in college contexts. However, these high rates of drinking subsequently fall once students graduate from college [69].\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The query was posed only to the Alcohol Users (Adult & Adolescents) and not to the Spouses of Drinkers. Obviously, it was very pathetic to see that 63.4% of the Adults and 58.4% of the Adolescents have faced problems, while they tried to stop drinking. Further, 37.7% of the Adults had faced multiple problems. Multiple withdrawal problems were found to be comparatively less (15.9%) among the Adolescent Drinkers and headache and fidgety/restless was the major difficulties they faced when they cut down/stopped drinking. Further, 12.4% reported that they had a problem of „Unable to sleep‟. (Refer to table 2.6.7) Category-wise, the figure 2.6.2 showed that withdrawal problems were more (83.5%) among the Harmful Drinkers (Adults) compared to the Less-Harmful Drinkers (54.6%).

According to a WHO report, 5.3% of all deaths that occurred worldwide in the year 2016 were because of harmful alcohol use [1]. It is the main culprit behind the advancing nature of many chronic diseases. It drastically increases the severity of diseases and also makes the treatments less effective. Alcohol not only affects the person physiologically, but it has many adverse effects psychologically and socially too. Also, the habit of alcoholism leads to huge expenses [2] –[3]. However, alcohol does not just affect society, it also affects the health of children, women and couples as the average population is responsible to around 3.5 billion people [4]. In many ways, alcohol consumption, coupled with its negative effects negatively affects the quality of life for an individual. As well as health, alcohol consumption adversely affects human life. Alcoholics are often forced to consume a number of drugs, including alcoholic tea, alcoholics are often encouraged to smoke, it is difficult to reduce their consumption while in health care centres to get the best results while being aware of the need for abstinence prevention. As well as for their physical illnesses and social health they are also exposed to problems because alcohol itself does not contribute towards health[5].\\n\\n.

According to a WHO report, 5.3% of all deaths that occurred worldwide in the year 2016 were because of harmful alcohol use [1]. It is the main culprit behind the advancing nature of many chronic diseases. It drastically increases the severity of diseases and also makes the treatments less effective. Alcohol not only affects the person physiologically, but it has many adverse effects psychologically and socially too. Also, the habit of alcoholism leads to huge expenses [2] in order to avoid the problems associated with that addiction. Alcohol consumption and alcoholism are related by many human health, but the latter as a whole also affect the development of the human personality in the short term. Although alcoholism can be dangerous and addictive, because of its strong psychological and physical effects, the effects on its symptoms is very limited. In many cases, it is difficult for the health care providers to detect the effects since the body constantly stores the negative data. Alcohol's toxicity and the effects on human health have a profound impact on health and wellbeing. In case you're not aware, alcoholism is widely recognised by the world as the leading cause of death (and the most destructive of all infectious diseases) in the world[3]. It is estimated that up to two billion people suffer from alcoholism[4]. The number of deaths from alcoholism is very high for a disease which affects about one-third of humans worldwide,[3] and the majority is due to the human body's metabolism. Alcoholic consumption is an important part of a growing world that is rapidly changing. The world can't cope with the impact of alcohol. This article discusses the impact of alcohol and alcoholism on human health: The impact of alcohol on human health, and potential consequences. Introduction Alcohol and alcohol dependent people In many circumstances, it is only alcohol that causes alcohol dependence, and there are certain benefits of it to the human body. In some circumstances the relationship with a specific alcohol problem that has affected a person is not clear. Because of the very high level of alcohol consumption and consumption in most countries, it is possible to avoid the problem at all costs, and to improve the health of the patient, with the knowledge that alcohol may help. Nevertheless, the use of alcohol can cause serious side effects and in some cases serious complications of the condition. One of the main methods of controlling alcohol in some forms of treatment is to give it to children as an antidote when drinking a lot and to give it to children where they can stop drinking in the morning or evening. Also the use of alcohol by young people has a dramatic effect on all\n"
